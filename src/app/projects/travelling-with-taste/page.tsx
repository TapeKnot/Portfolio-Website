            <i>Travelling With Taste</i> is a stealth-platforming game for Windows.
            Players control rats in a suitcase as they steal from cheese-trafficking airport security.
            After infiltrating the airport’s backrooms, players must solve puzzles, sneak past guards, and collect as much cheese as possible before their escape flight leaves.

            I served as lead AI programmer for the project in a team of 7 students.
            Over the course of 8 weeks, we developed a polished gameplay experience.
            My responsibilities included creating a complete enemy system capable of patrolling levels, detecting the player in their line of sight, and being distracted by items.
            I also developed shaders and UI to stylize our game’s visuals and provide additional player feedback.
